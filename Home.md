Welcome to the Java-Performance-Problems wiki!


top common problems:

slow database queires-JDBC monitoring(eg p6spy), tune sql

inefficent application code- execution profile(jvisualvm), tune code

too many db quries-jdbc monitoring(p6spy), refactor calls

commcurrency issues-stack trace analysis

memorry leaks-heap dump analyser(eclipse MAT),identify the objects retaigning memory and fix the code to stop that

configuration issue(pooling thresolds,request throtting)-keep record to changes

slow DB-JDBC monitoring(p6spy), find clusters or slow queries

GC pauses-gc logging and gc logs analyzer(gc viewer)

memeory-look for object allcoation in memory profiler(jvisualvm)
